# default-template

This is the default component generated by the
[create-origami-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-origami-component)
tool.

We use a non-o prefixed name which gives us one warning.

The tool is also built to recommend using `component` instead of `module` as the
`origamiType`, so that gives us a second warning :).
