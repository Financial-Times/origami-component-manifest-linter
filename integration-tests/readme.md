# integration tests

This folder contains a `test.js` file that provides a test runner, and a series
of directories that provide fixtures.

The components are stored in a structure like this:

```text
├── names-arent-the-same
│   ├── component
│   │   ├── bower.json
│   │   ├── origami.json
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── github.json
```

The `github.json` file contains a structure the same as what is created by the
parse functions above:

```json
{
	"errors": {
		"bower-npm-names-no-match" : {
			"file": "package.json",
			"line": 2,
			"col": 10
		}
	},
	"warnings": {}
}
```

The `model.json` file contains the entire component model.

In the test runner, we execute the cli on each of the `test-name/component`
directories, and create a [tap](https://node-tap.org/) test for each one,
checking that the parsed github output matches the `github.json` file and that
the model matches the `model.json` file.

## creating tests

The `github.json` files are expected to be written by hand, so that you're being
thoughtful and will catch things that aren't right.
The `model.json` file can be generated by running `node
. integration-tests/my-test/component model >
integration-tests/my-test/model.json` in the root of the
origami-component-manifest-linter project.
